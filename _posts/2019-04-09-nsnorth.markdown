Last March, I gave a [7-minute speech at a reading series](https://matthewbischoff.com/culture-rot/) that scratched my persistent itch to be in front of a crowd. But in 2019 I want to get back into my usual schtick of giving longer, prepared presentations with slides. I love attending conferences, and I especially enjoy having the opportunity to hone a talk and share it with a group of my peers.

Later this month, Iâ€™ll be heading north to speak at (the appropriately named) NSNorth 2019. NSNorth is Canadaâ€™s premier independent Apple developer and designer conference, and like [Ã‡ingleton](http://cingleton.com) in years past, itâ€™s taking place in beautiful MontrÃ©al, QuÃ©bec. Iâ€™ve never been to this conference before, but Iâ€™ve met the organizers at other events, and Iâ€™ve heard great things.

My talk is called _Growing Pains_ and itâ€™s about the things that break as your software team or [company](https://lickability.com) gets bigger and what you can do to make that a less painful process. If youâ€™d like to hear more about the conference and my experience on the topic, [Dan](https://twitter.com/_danbyers) and [Phil](https://twitter.com/philippec) interviewed me on the [NSNorth Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-nsnorth-podcast/id599959952?mt=2). Give it a listen below or wherever you get your podcasts:

Finally, the organizers have announced that this is the last year for NSNorth for the foreseeable future, so if youâ€™ve always wanted to attend, nowâ€™s your chance. If you need help convincing your boss to cover the cost, theyâ€™ve [got you covered](https://nsnorth.ca/convince-your-boss.pdf). **[Tickets are on sale](https://tickets.nsnorth.ca) until this Friday, April 12, so act fast.** _Je vais te voir lÃ -bas!_ ðŸ‘‹
