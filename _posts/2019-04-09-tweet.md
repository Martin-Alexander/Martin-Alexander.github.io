Last March, I gave a [7-minute speech at a reading series](https://matthewbischoff.com/culture-rot/) that scratched my persistent itch to be in front of a crowd. But in 2019 I want to get back into my usual schtick of giving longer, prepared presentations with slides. I love attending conferences, and I especially enjoy having the opportunity to hone a talk and share it with a group of my peers.
